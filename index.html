    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>After graduating college with a Master's of Arts in Teaching, I became an elementary school teacher.  I have taught in the classroom for eight years.  While I love teaching, I also really enjoy learning myself.  Because my daily lessons hinged on technology such as websites and applications, I became curious about their development.</p>

    <p>Following my research on software development, I knew switching into a tech career was going to be the right decision for me based on qualities I gained as a classroom teacher, such as: collaboration, problem solving, creativity, and ingenuity.</p>

    <p>Outside of web development, I relish in listening to podcasts, reading books, watching inspiring films and shows, and being outdoors.  My family and I appreciate nature and travel to many National Parks.

    <p>As an aspiring student at Thinkful, I've just begun my journey to becoming a software developer and with a lot of determination, perseverance, and grit, I will succeed!</p>
